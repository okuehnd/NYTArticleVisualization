That's 27 Democrats, each one representing about 315,000 voters, and 46 Republicans, each representing about 130,000 voters. Added together, that's about 6 million voters in Assembly districts and 8.5 million in Senate districts who are effectively deprived of representation because their representatives are kept out of the legislative loop.     Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, and Assemblyman Tom Kirwan, a Republican from Newburgh, have now taken the state's political leaders to court -- arguing before State Supreme Court Judge Jane Solomon that their ability to represent their constituents has been unfairly and in some cases unconstitutionally limited by Governor George Pataki, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.

The accusation may well have an impact on the myriad lawsuits filed against Merck because it undermines Merck's contention that it disclosed all it knew about the risks of Vioxx. More broadly, the incident underscores the danger that industry-backed studies may not tell the whole truth about products vital to a company's bottom line.     The paper in question was published in The New England Journal of Medicine five years ago. It found a small increase in heart attacks among patients taking Vioxx as compared to those taking another painkiller, naproxen, but explained the difference away by suggesting that naproxen actually protected people from heart attacks, rather than Vioxx causing them.  \",\"A guide to cultural and recreational events in Connecticut.\",\"A Chicago victory in Copenhagen on Friday is expected to generate a network TV bidding war over the 2016 Olympics.\",\"Correction of July 31 article on search for directors for two New York museums; Ned Rifkin has not talked to Whitney Museum's search committee\",\"Thursday: What to do if you feel you\\u2019re in danger, and Tennis for Two.\",\"It is common in today\\u2019s N.B.A. to see players using basketball moves, most notably the Euro step, that originated outside the United States.\",\"The city's public school choice process has left many parents and children stressed.\",\"An agreement on a five-year deal worth $100 million for Drew Brees, the star quarterback, arrives as the Saints are coming off an off-season of scandal and suspension.\",\"Marian Burros comments on importance of folic acid in diet, where it has been found to offer protection against birth defects, cardiovascular disease and now Alzheimer's disease; notes green vegetables are good source of folic acid; photo (M)\",\"While it\\u2019s not an opportunity to \\u201cdress like Cookie,\\u201d the clothing line may signal a new stage in pop culture/designer partnerships.\",\"Two African-American executives, caught in an elevator during a building crisis, discuss matters of class and sex as well their own threatened physical safety.\",\"Jenny Moore is leaving the contemporary art museum established by Donald Judd, after nine years as the director and following the completion of the first part of its multiyear master plan.\",\"President Obama and his allies, concerned about deep skepticism over his landmark health care overhaul, are orchestrating an elaborate campaign to sell the public on the law.\",\"An office furniture designer says ergonomic tools can help break the monotony of the workday.\",\"An advocacy group had argued that the elephant was being illegally detained at the Bronx Zoo, in a case involving ethical questions about the rights of highly intelligent animals.\",\"John G.

The upper crust vacationed in Europe and worshiped an Episcopal God. The middle class drove Ford Fairlanes, settled the San Fernando Valley and enlisted as company men. The working class belonged to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., voted Democratic and did not take cruises to the Caribbean.    Today, the country has gone a long way toward an appearance of classlessness. Americans of all sorts are awash in luxuries that would have dazzled their grandparents. Social diversity has erased many of the old markers. It has become harder to read people's status in the clothes they wear, the cars they drive, the votes they cast, the god they worship, the color of their skin.

In that sense, it was surprising that he would choose it as the subject of his first encyclical.

New York State's top three leaders have found extremely efficient ways to silence the minority parties -- Democrats in the State Senate, Republicans in the Assembly. That's 27 Democrats, each one representing about 315,000 voters, and 46 Republicans, each representing about 130,000 voters. Added together, that's about 6 million voters in Assembly districts and 8.5 million in Senate districts who are effectively deprived of representation because their representatives are kept out of the legislative loop.     Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, and Assemblyman Tom Kirwan, a Republican from Newburgh, have now taken the state's political leaders to court -- arguing before State Supreme Court Judge Jane Solomon that their ability to represent their constituents has been unfairly and in some cases unconstitutionally limited by Governor George Pataki, Senate Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.

The accusation may well have an impact on the myriad lawsuits filed against Merck because it undermines Merck's contention that it disclosed all it knew about the risks of Vioxx. More broadly, the incident underscores the danger that industry-backed studies may not tell the whole truth about products vital to a company's bottom line.     The paper in question was published in The New England Journal of Medicine five years ago. It found a small increase in heart attacks among patients taking Vioxx as compared to those taking another painkiller, naproxen, but explained the difference away by suggesting that naproxen actually protected people from heart attacks, rather than Vioxx causing them.  \",\"A guide to cultural and recreational events in Connecticut.\",\"A Chicago victory in Copenhagen on Friday is expected to generate a network TV bidding war over the 2016 Olympics.\",\"Correction of July 31 article on search for directors for two New York museums; Ned Rifkin has not talked to Whitney Museum's search committee\",\"Thursday: What to do if you feel you\\u2019re in danger, and Tennis for Two.\",\"It is common in today\\u2019s N.B.A. to see players using basketball moves, most notably the Euro step, that originated outside the United States.\",\"The city's public school choice process has left many parents and children stressed.\",\"An agreement on a five-year deal worth $100 million for Drew Brees, the star quarterback, arrives as the Saints are coming off an off-season of scandal and suspension.\",\"Marian Burros comments on importance of folic acid in diet, where it has been found to offer protection against birth defects, cardiovascular disease and now Alzheimer's disease; notes green vegetables are good source of folic acid; photo (M)\",\"While it\\u2019s not an opportunity to \\u201cdress like Cookie,\\u201d the clothing line may signal a new stage in pop culture/designer partnerships.\",\"Two African-American executives, caught in an elevator during a building crisis, discuss matters of class and sex as well their own threatened physical safety.\",\"Jenny Moore is leaving the contemporary art museum established by Donald Judd, after nine years as the director and following the completion of the first part of its multiyear master plan.\",\"President Obama and his allies, concerned about deep skepticism over his landmark health care overhaul, are orchestrating an elaborate campaign to sell the public on the law.\",\"An office furniture designer says ergonomic tools can help break the monotony of the workday.\",\"An advocacy group had argued that the elephant was being illegally detained at the Bronx Zoo, in a case involving ethical questions about the rights of highly intelligent animals.\",\"John G.
